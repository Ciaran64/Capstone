## London energy and weather time series forecasting
### This project seeks to create a model that can accurately predict how different types of weather can be used to predict energy consumption

### The data sets that will be compared over this model will be from the London data store, that contains the energy consumption readings for a sample of 5,567 London Households that took part in the UK Power Networks led Low Carbon London project between November 2011 and February 2014. The data from the smart meters is associated only to the electrical consumption. Equally there will be daily weather data collected from darksky which alligns with the same dates as the energy consumption.

### Energy provisers, governments and stakeholders in a modern era of renewable energy need to make accurate forecasting on how to accurately predict energy consumption.  A large contributing factor of how energy is utilized is dependant on the weather.  
##  With the London energy dataset and the and the Darksky data we can study how this weather influences energy consumption on both a daily and seasonal basis
